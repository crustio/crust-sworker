# Crust TEE
Implement the trusted layer based on TEE technology, functionally connect  the consensus layer, and be responsible for the trusted verification of the resource layer.

## Preparation work
- Hardware requirements: 

  CPU must contain SGX module, and make sure the SGX function is turned on in the bios
- Operating system requirements:

  Unbantu 16.04

## Dependent library and project
- [Intel SGX](https://software.intel.com/en-us/sgx)
- [Crust](https://github.com/crustio/crust)
- [Crust API](https://github.com/crustio/crust-api)

## Development launch
### Package
- Run '**scripts/package.sh**' to package whole project, you will get a **crust-\<version\>.tar** package.

### Install
1. Copy TEE application package to your machine, run '**tar -xvf crust-\<version\>.tar**' to extract package.
1. Cd to the extract folder, run '**scripts/install.sh**' to install TEE application. Related dependencies will be installed on your machine. TEE application will be installed on '**/opt/crust/crust-tee**' directory.

### Start
Crust TEE apllication is installed in /opt/crust/crust-tee.
1. In etc/Config.json file you can configure your TEE application configure.
1. After configuration, run '**scripts/start.sh**' to start TEE application.
1. Run '**scripts/stop.sh**' to stop TEE application.
1. Run '**scripts/status.sh -s,--status**' to get process information.
1. Run '**scripts/status.sh -p,--plot**' to get and printf validation status.
1. Run '**scripts/status.sh -r,--report**' to get work report.

### Launch crust chain and API
- Crust TEE will wait for the chain to run before uploading identity information and performing file verification. So if you want to test whole TEE flow, please lanuch crust chain and API.

## Client launch
### Package
- Run '**scripts/package.sh**' to package whole project, you will get a **crust-\<version\>.tar** package.

### Crust client
- Please follow [crust client](https://github.com/crustio/crust-client) to launch.

## Crust tee executable file
1. Run '**bin/crust-tee -h**' to show how to use **crust-tee**.
1. Run '**bin/crust-tee \<argument\>**' to run crust-tee in different mode, argument can be daemon/server/status/report.
   1. **daemon** option lets tee run in daemon mode.
   1. **server** option lets tee run in server mode.
   1. **status** option shows tee current status, make sure daemon or server mode has been running.
   1. **report** option shows tee work report, make sure daemon or server mode has been running.
1. Run '**bin/crust-tee -c \<config_file_path\>**' to use customized configure file, if not provided **etc/Config.json** will be used as the default one.

## API
- Use 'curl http://<api_base_url_in_Config.json>/api/v0/status' to get validation status
- Use 'curl http://<api_base_url_in_Config.json>/api/v0/report' to get work report

## Contribution

Thank you for considering to help out with the source code! We welcome contributions from anyone on the internet, and are grateful for even the smallest of fixes!

If you'd like to contribute to crust, please **fork, fix, commit and send a pull request for the maintainers to review and merge into the main codebase**.

### Rules

Please make sure your contribution adhere to our coding guideliness:

- **No --force pushes** or modifying the master branch history in any way. If you need to rebase, ensure you do it in your own repo.
- Pull requests need to be based on and opened against the `master branch`.
- A pull-request **must not be merged until CI** has finished successfully.
- Make sure your every `commit` is [signed](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/about-commit-signature-verification)

### Merge process

Merging pull requests once CI is successful:

- A PR needs to be reviewed and approved by project maintainers;
- PRs that break the external API must be tagged with [`breaksapi`](https://github.com/crustio/crust-tee/labels/breakapi);
- No PR should be merged until **all reviews' comments** are addressed.
